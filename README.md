self reminders:
to delete the auto generated /etc/resolve.conf upon a new installation since i'm using dnscrypt-proxy;
there is a bug in current wine/proton that 'right click' context menu doesn work with the env PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND = 1, unless you are opening a non-game in proton this does not matter;
generate monitor.conf by using nwg-displays, then re-run nixos builder

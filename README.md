# nixos-dotfiles from 🥔

this is just the personal dotfiles that i use, hyprland + home manager + [DankMaterialShell
](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell);

**reminders for future instalations:**

delete the auto generated /etc/resolve.conf upon a new installation since i'm using dnscrypt-proxy;

generate monitor.conf by using nwg-displays, then re-run nixos builder

there is a bug in current wine/proton that 'right click' context menu doesn work with the env PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND = 1, unless you are opening a non-game.
